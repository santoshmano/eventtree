Overview
=========
The MVP continuous-dev repo/branch. 

Coding Guidelines
==================

The only coding guideline that will be enforced for V1 is 4.

1. Clear concise code, with minimal documentation.

2.  Backend - Use Pep8 standards when in doubt or as a first approach.
    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

    Frontend - ? 

3. Whitespaces (most preferrable)

    LineWrap  - 80 Columns 
    Backend   - 4 spaces, with expandtab(4 spaces for a tab stroke) 
    Frontend  - 4/2 spaces, based on user/file preference. When in doubt use
                what is used in the existing file. HTML files may generally go
                over 80 columns, so to accommodate that developer may have used
                2 spaces instead of 4.
    LineBreaks - between logical chunks, functions. 

4. Comments
    Try to comment non-obvious pieces/functions. Document complicated pieces,
    any tips/tricks discovered, primarily to help other developers to be able
    to fix bugs/write tests/review.

5. Commit Messages
    Provide detailed commit messages. Use "git commit"
