Readme before starting to work off this branch.
Read the Developers Guide for more detailed information.

To startoff
===========
Always checkout the mvp_v_0_X branch and work out of it, not off the master.

Overview
=========
The MVP continuous-dev repo has the following Branches
 - master branch
    This is the production ready, stable branch. The integration from the mvp
    branches are done only by a single person at a point when the mvp1_X is 
    deemed complete/stable after going over testing. The only other time to 
    work on this branch is to provide hotfixes.
   
 - mvp1_1 branch
    This is the branch to develop all pieces for the initial mvp - the landing
    page. The mvp branches are public to the team. The team can submit directly
    into this branch after basic sanity testing so that others are not broken
    or is free to create private branches for their own features and later merge
    into the mvp branch. 
    

Coding Guidelines
==================
The only coding guideline that will be enforced for V1 is 5.

1. Clear concise code, with minimal documentation.

2.  Backend - Use Pep8 standards when in doubt or as a first approach.
    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

    Frontend - ? 

3. Whitespaces (most preferrable)

    LineWrap  - 80 Columns 
    Backend   - 4 spaces, with expandtab(4 spaces for a tab stroke) 
    Frontend  - 2 spaces.
    LineBreaks - between logical chunks, functions. 

4. Comments
    Try to comment non-obvious pieces/functions. Document complicated pieces,
    any tips/tricks discovered, primarily to help other developers to be able
    to fix bugs/write tests/review.

5. Commit Messages
    Provide detailed commit messages. Use "git commit"

<Sample Format>

Enh</Iss/Ref> - One liner

<Detailed description here>

Tests 
  Test 1 - Details
  Test 2 - Details

</Sample Format>

    If the developer is doing frequent smaller commits to team branch, it is ok
    to provide one line commit message, but the feature start/end should 
    contain detailed commit message like above, and the smaller one liners should
    have something linking to the main feature/issue/fix reference.
